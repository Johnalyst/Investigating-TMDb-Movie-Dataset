# Investigating-TMDb-Movie-Dataset


In this project I would be analysing TMDb movie dataset movie dataset. Analysing a movie dataset is really a captivating and intriguing one, because a movie 'is a work of visual art that simulates experiences and otherwise communicates ideas, stories, perceptions, feelings, beauty, or atmosphere through the use of moving images. [(Wikipedia)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Film). So, with this data we aim at providing key facts about the movie world and also trends and behaviours behind successful and profitable movies.

Like every work of art it requires the viewers or audience to appreciate it, as art belongs as much to the audience that interacts with it as it does to the artist who creates it. With the aid of this data we would be able to come to a realization of how much movies has been appreciated through the years and decades, and how the audience, actors, directors and production companies have all played an integral part in the growth of the movie industry over the years.

To achieve our aim of this project, through the course of our analysis we would be going through different stages, **firstly**, we would be wrangling our data, at this stage we aim at cleaning the data and also checking out the quality of the data. This stage would see us drop some irrelevant columns and also create new columns that would aid our analysis. Checking of datatypes, null values and also duplicates are also assessed at this stage and corrected.  **Secondly**, exploring our data and visualization. at this stage we explore our data to get useful informations and trends, for our movie lovers and also movie crew and actors, and with the help of deaborn and matplotlib we visualize some of the trends for better analysis and understanding. 
    Some questions at this stage which helped in getting us through this stage are: 
    **what are the most expensive movies by budget? 
    Most Successful movies  by profit?  
    Most Successful movies by percentage change budget and profit? and; 
    Movies that made complete lost?  
    Directors with most movies?  
    Directors to look out for in popular movie genres?  
    Actor with most movies overall and also by every decade?** 
    These questions and many more kept the entertainment going during the analysis. **Thirdly**, We arrive at our conclusion, at this stage we draw our curtain to this analysis and take our final bow, and also give out recommendations derived with our analysis to movie viewers, actors, directors and production companies, which would be a useful asset in the movie world.
